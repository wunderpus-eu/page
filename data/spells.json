The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the detection glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.\n\nBoth glyphs are nearly invisible, and finding either requires a successful **Intelligence (Investigation) check** against your spell save DC.\n\nYou decide what triggers the detection glyph when you cast this spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.\n\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\n\nWhen you inscribe the detection glyph, choose an alarm glyph or spell glyph to link to it.\n\n**Alarm Glyph**\nYou create and magically link two glyphs: a detection glyph and an effect glyph. Each of these two glyphs must stay within 100 miles of the other or the spell effect ends. When the detection glyph is triggered, the effect glyph reacts like an alarm spell, creating a mental ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the effect glyph. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.\n\n**Spell Glyph**\nYou create and magically link two glyphs: a detection glyph and an effect glyph. These two glyphs must be within 100 feet of each other. You can store a prepared spell of 4th level or lower in the effect glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyphs. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the detection glyph is triggered, the spell stored in the effect glyph is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on the effect glyph.

It carries an open, empty chest whose interior dimensions are 3 feet on each side. While the spell lasts, you can deposit as many items inside the chest as will fit. You can then name a living creature you have met and seen at least once before, or any creature for which you possess a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a nail, or similar portion of the creature's body.\n\nAs soon as the lid of the chest is closed, the elemental and the chest disappear, then reappear adjacent to the target creature. If the target creature is on another plane, or if it is proofed against magical detection or location, the contents of the chest reappear on the ground at your feet.\n\nThe target creature is made aware of the chest's contents before it chooses whether or not to open it, and knows how much of the spell's duration remains in which it can retrieve them. No other creature can open the chest and retrieve its contents. When the spell expires or when all the contents of the chest have been removed, the elemental and the chest disappear. The elemental also disappears if the target creature orders it to return the items to you. When the elemental disappears, any items not taken from the chest reappear on the ground at your feet.",

If the object is securely attached to a surface or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance. When the animated object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object form, and any remaining damage carries over to its original object form.\n\nIf you command an object to attack, it can make a single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and `bludgeoning damage` determined by its size. The DM might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or `piercing damage` based on its form.",

    "description": "A 10-foot-radius invisible `sphere` of antimagic surrounds you. This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the `sphere`, spells can't be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the `sphere` moves with you, centered on you.\n\nSpells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the `sphere` and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.\n\n**Targeted Effects**\nSpells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the `sphere` have no effect on that target.\n\n**Areas of Magic**\nThe area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can't extend into the `sphere`. If the `sphere` overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the `sphere` is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the `sphere`, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.\n\n**Spells**\nAny active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the `sphere` is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.\n\n**Magic Items**\nThe properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the `sphere`. For example, a +1 longsword in the `sphere` functions as a nonmagical longsword.\n\nA magic weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the `sphere` or wielded by an attacker in the `sphere`. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the `sphere` (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the `sphere`), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.\n\n**Magical Travel**\nTeleportation and planar travel fail to work in the `sphere`, whether the `sphere` is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the `sphere`.\n\n**Creatures and Objects**\nA creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the `sphere`. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the `sphere`.\n\n**Dispel Magic**\nSpells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the `sphere`. Likewise, the spheres created by different antimagic field spells don't nullify each other.",

You target something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or an area that is no larger than a 200-foot `cube`. Then specify a kind of intelligent creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura's effect.\n\n**Antipathy**\nThe enchantment causes creatures of the kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a **Wisdom saving throw** or become **frightened**. The creature remains **frightened** while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While **frightened** by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can't see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can't see it, the creature is no longer **frightened**, but the creature becomes **frightened** again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.\n\n**Sympathy**\nThe enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a **Wisdom saving throw** or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target. When the creature has done so, it can't willingly move away from the target.\n\nIf the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a **Wisdom saving throw** to end the effect, as described below.\n\n**Ending the Effect**\nIf an affected creature ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the creature makes a **Wisdom saving throw**. On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by the spell is allowed another **Wisdom saving throw** every 24 hours while the spell persists.\n\nA creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.",

If the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the creature's astral form back to its body, ending its state of suspended animation.\n\nIf you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit points.",

You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an `action` on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.\n\n**Flood**\nYou cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.\n\nIf you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a No effect chance of capsizing.\n\nThe water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.\n\n**Part Water**\nYou cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.\n\n**Redirect Flow**\nYou cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.\n\n**Whirlpool**\nThis effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a **Strength (Athletics) check** against your spell save DC.\n\nWhen a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a **Strength saving throw**. On a failed save, the creature takes **2d8** `bludgeoning damage` and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its `action` to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the **Strength (Athletics) check** to do so.\n\nThe first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes **2d8** `bludgeoning damage`; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.",

Each creature on the ground that is **concentrating** must make a **Constitution saving throw**. On a failed save, the creature's **concentration** is broken.\n\nWhen you cast this spell and at the end of each turn you spend **concentrating** on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a **Dexterity saving throw**. On a failed save, the creature is knocked **prone**.\n\nThis spell can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the DM.\n\n**Fissures**\nFissures open throughout the spell's area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total of **1d6** such fissures open in locations chosen by the DM. Each is **1d10 × 10** feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell's area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a **Dexterity saving throw** or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure's edge as it opens.\n\nA fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below).\n\n**Structures**\nThe tremor deals 50 `bludgeoning damage` to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure's height must make a **Dexterity saving throw**. On a failed save, the creature takes **5d6** `bludgeoning damage`, is knocked **prone**, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a **DC 20** **Strength (Athletics) check** as an `action` to escape. The DM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn't fall **prone** or become buried.",

Additionally, as an `action`, you can see through your familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are **deaf** and **blind** with regard to your own senses.\n\nYou can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.\n\nFinally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its `reaction` to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.",

While you are traveling there, whenever you are presented with a choice of paths along the way, you automatically determine which path is the shortest and most direct route (but not necessarily the safest route) to the destination.",

Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. When a chosen creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature takes **5d10** radiant or `necrotic damage` (your choice when you cast this spell).\n\nWhen you cast this spell, you can designate a password. A creature that speaks the password as it enters the area takes no damage from the spell.\n\nThe spell's area can't overlap with the area of another forbiddance spell. If you cast forbiddance every day for 30 days in the same location, the spell lasts until it is dispelled, and the material components are consumed on the last casting.",

You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.\n\nThe glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful **Intelligence (Investigation) check** against your spell save DC to be found.\n\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.\n\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\n\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.\n\n**Explosive Runes**\nWhen triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius `sphere` centered on the glyph. The `sphere` spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a **Dexterity saving throw**. A creature takes **5d8** acid, cold, fire, lightning, or `thunder damage` on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\n**Spell Glyph**\nYou can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires **concentration**, it lasts until the end of its full duration.",

When a creature that would be affected enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it can make a **Charisma saving throw**. On a success, the creature ignores the extra effect until it leaves the area.\n\n**Courage**\nAffected creatures can't be **frightened** while in the area.\n\n**Darkness**\nDarkness fills the area. Normal light, as well as magical light created by spells of a lower level than the slot you used to cast this spell, can't illuminate the area.\n\n**Daylight**\n**Bright light** fills the area.

Divination spells can't locate or perceive the target.\n\nWhen you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of imprisonment.\n\n**Burial**\nThe target is entombed far beneath the earth in a `sphere` of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the `sphere`, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it.\n\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb.\n\n**Chaining**\nHeavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The target is **restrained** until the spell ends, and it can't move or be moved by any means until then.\n\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal.\n\n**Hedged Prison**\nThe spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice.\n\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.\n\n**Minimus Containment**\nThe target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can't be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect.\n\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.\n\n**Slumber**\nThe target falls asleep and can't be awoken.\n\nThe special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs.\n\n**Ending the Spell**\nDuring the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points.\n\nA dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it.\n\nYou can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target of the first casting is immediately freed from its binding.",

The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can't create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal `thunder damage` or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte's stench).\n\nAs long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your `action` to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.\n\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its `action` to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful **Intelligence (Investigation) check** against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.",

This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\n\nThe phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature.\n\nThe target can use its `action` to examine the phantasm with an **Intelligence (Investigation) check** against your spell save DC.

For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall—it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.\n\nAn affected target is so convinced of the phantasm's reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal **1d6** `psychic damage` to the target if it is in the phantasm's area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking.

    "description": "You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being must be known to you: a god, a primordial, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic power. That entity sends a miscellaneous=!swarm, an miscellaneous=!swarm, or a miscellaneous=!swarm loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a specific creature's name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (DM's choice).\n\nWhen the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn't obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.\n\nPayment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth `100 gp` per minute. A task measured in hours requires `1,000 gp` per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires `10,000 gp` per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.\n\nAfter the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature's service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.\n\nA creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded.",

    "description": "A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque wall—up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick—centered on a point you can see within range. Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a `sphere` up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within range. The wall remains in place for the duration. If you position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your `action` and the spell slot are wasted.\n\nThe wall sheds **bright light** out to a range of 100 feet and **dim light** for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a **Constitution saving throw** or become **blinded** for 1 minute.\n\nThe wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall's layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a **Dexterity saving throw** or be affected by that layer's properties as described below.\n\nThe wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the spell. An antimagic field has no effect on a prismatic wall.\n\n**Red**\nThe creature takes **10d6** `fire damage` on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, nonmagical ranged attacks can't pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 `cold damage` to it.\n\n**Orange**\nThe creature takes **10d6** `acid damage` on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, magical ranged attacks can't pass through the wall. The layer is destroyed by a strong wind.\n\n**Yellow**\nThe creature takes **10d6** `lightning damage` on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 `force damage` to it.\n\n**Green**\nThe creature takes **10d6** `poison damage` on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A passwall spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer.\n\n**Blue**\nThe creature takes **10d6** `cold damage` on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 `fire damage` to it.\n\n**Indigo**\nOn a failed save, the creature is **restrained**. It must then make a **Constitution saving throw** at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the **petrified** condition. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind.\n\nWhile this layer is in place, spells can't be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by **bright light** shed by a daylight spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level.\n\n**Violet**\nOn a failed save, the creature is **blinded**. It must then make a **Wisdom saving throw** at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the DM's choosing and is no longer **blinded**. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn't its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a dispel magic spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end spells and magical effects.",

You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between.

If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.\n\nA creature can use its `action` to inspect a target and make an **Intelligence (Investigation) check** against your spell save DC.

If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus listed in its statistics is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus in place of yours. You can't use any legendary `actions` or lair `actions` of the new form.\n\nYou assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form.

If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked **unconscious**.\n\nYou retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically capable of doing so. You can't use any special senses you have (for example, **darkvision**) unless your new form also has that sense. You can only speak if the creature can normally speak.\n\nWhen you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal. The DM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your new form. Equipment that merges has no effect in that state.\n\nDuring this spell's duration, you can use your `action` to assume a different form following the same restrictions and rules for the original form, with one exception: if your new form has more hit points than your current one, your hit points remain at their current value.",

    "description": "When you cast this spell, you inscribe a harmful glyph either on a surface (such as a section of floor, a wall, or a table) or within an object that can be closed to conceal the glyph (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest). If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.\n\nThe glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an **Intelligence (Investigation) check** against your spell save DC to find it.\n\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.\n\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature's physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\n\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius `sphere` with **dim light** for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the `sphere` when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the `sphere` for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.\n\n**Death**\nEach target must make a **Constitution saving throw**, taking **10d10** `necrotic damage` on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.\n\n**Discord**\nEach target must make a **Constitution saving throw**. On a failed save, a target bickers and argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.\n\n**Fear**\nEach target must make a **Wisdom saving throw** and becomes **frightened** for 1 minute on a failed save. While **frightened**, the target drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.\n\n**Hopelessness**\nEach target must make a **Charisma saving throw**. On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can't attack or target any creature with harmful abilities, spells, or other magical effects.\n\n**Insanity**\nEach target must make an **Intelligence saving throw**. On a failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can't take `actions`, can't understand what other creatures say, can't read, and speaks only in gibberish. The DM controls its movement, which is erratic.\n\n**Pain**\nEach target must make a **Constitution saving throw** and becomes **incapacitated** with excruciating pain for 1 minute on a failed save.\n\n**Sleep**\nEach target must make a **Wisdom saving throw** and falls **unconscious** for 10 minutes on a failed save. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an `action` to shake or slap it awake.\n\n**Stunning**\nEach target must make a **Wisdom saving throw** and becomes **stunned** for 1 minute on a failed save.",

    "description": "This spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range, or a single object that you can see within range, to a destination you select. If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot `cube`, and it can't be held or carried by an unwilling creature.\n\nThe destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The DM rolls **d100** and consults the table.\n\n| Familiarity | Mishap | Similar Area | Off Target | On Target |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Permanent circle | — | — | — | 01–100 |\n| Associated object | — | — | — | 01–100 |\n| Very familiar | 01–05 | 06–13 | 14–24 | 25–100 |\n| Seen casually | 01–33 | 34–43 | 44–53 | 54–100 |\n| Viewed once | 01–43 | 44–53 | 54–73 | 74–100 |\n| Description | 01–43 | 44–53 | 54–73 | 74–100 |\n| False destination | 01–50 | 51–100 | — | — |\n\n**Familiarity**\n\"Permanent circle\" means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know. \"Associated object\" means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard's library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich's secret tomb.\n\n\"Very familiar\" is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. \"Seen casually\" is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you aren't very familiar. \"Viewed once\" is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic. \"Description\" is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else's description, perhaps from a map.\n\n\"False destination\" is a place that doesn't exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.\n\n**On Target**\nYou and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.\n\n**Off Target**\nYou and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is **1d10 × 1d10** percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two **d10**s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a **d8** and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.\n\n**Similar Area**\nYou and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.\n\n**Mishap**\nThe spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes **3d10** `force damage`, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).",

The creature can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.\n\n**Object into Creature**\nYou can turn an object into any kind of creature, as long as the creature's size is no larger than the object's size and the creature's challenge rating is miscellaneous=!swarm.

On a failed save, the creature is **restrained** as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.\n\nA creature **restrained** by the webs can use its `action` to make a **Strength check** against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer **restrained**.\n\nThe webs are flammable. Any 5-foot `cube` of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing **2d4** `fire damage` to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.",

    "description": "Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.\n\nThe basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don't need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect. Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:\n\n- You create one object of up to `25,000 gp` in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.\n- You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.\n- You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.\n- You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich's life drain attack.\n- You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.\n\nYou might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.\n\nThe stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take **1d10** `necrotic damage` per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for **2d4** days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a Able to cast again chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.",

Otherwise, you must make a Charisma (**Deception**, **Intimidation**, or **Persuasion**) check contested by its **Wisdom (Insight) check**.

The area is 120 feet on each side, and it must not have any buildings or other structures on it. Any creatures in the area are harmlessly lifted up as the fortress rises.\n\nThe fortress has four turrets with square bases, each one 20 feet on a side and 30 feet tall, with one turret on each corner. The turrets are connected to each other by stone walls that are each 80 feet long, creating an enclosed area. Each wall is 1 foot thick and is composed of panels that are 10 feet wide and 20 feet tall. Each panel is contiguous with two other panels or one other panel and a turret. You can place up to four stone doors in the fortress's outer wall.\n\nA small keep stands inside the enclosed area. The keep has a square base that is 50 feet on each side, and it has three floors with 10-foot-high ceilings. Each of the floors can be divided into as many rooms as you like, provided each room is at least 5 feet on each side. The floors of the keep are connected by stone staircases, its walls are 6 inches thick, and interior rooms can have stone doors or open archways as you choose. The keep is furnished and decorated however you like, and it contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people each day. Furnishings, food, and other objects created by this spell crumble to dust if removed from the fortress.\n\nA staff of one hundred invisible servants obeys any command given to them by creatures you designate when you cast the spell. Each servant functions as if created by the unseen servant spell.\n\nThe walls, turrets, and keep are all made of stone that can be damaged. Each 10-foot-by-10-foot section of stone has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. It is immune to poison and `psychic damage`. Reducing a section of stone to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected sections to buckle and collapse at the DM's discretion.\n\nAfter 7 days or when you cast this spell somewhere else, the fortress harmlessly crumbles and sinks back into the ground, leaving any creatures that were inside it safely on the ground.\n\nCasting this spell on the same spot once every 7 days for a year makes the fortress permanent.",

The soul knows only what it knew in life, but it must answer you truthfully and to the best of its ability. The answer is no more than a sentence or two and might be cryptic.\n\n**Borrow Experience**\nYou can use a `bonus action` to bolster yourself with the soul's life experience, making your next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw with advantage. If you don't use this benefit before the start of your next turn, it is lost.\n\n**Eyes of the Dead**\nYou can use an `action` to name a place the humanoid saw in life, which creates an invisible sensor somewhere in that place if it is on the plane of existence you're currently on. The sensor remains for as long as you concentrate, up to 10 minutes (as if you were **concentrating** on a spell). You receive visual and auditory information from the sensor as if you were in its space using your senses.\n\nA creature that can see the sensor (such as one using see invisibility or **truesight**) sees a translucent image of the tormented humanoid whose soul you caged.",

Only you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell can open or close the door.\n\nThe temple's interior is an open space with an idol or altar at one end.

The smell of burning incense fills the air within, and the temperature is mild.\n\nThe temple opposes types of creatures you choose when you cast this spell. Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. If a creature of the chosen type attempts to enter the temple, that creature must make a **Charisma saving throw**. On a failed save, it can't enter the temple for 24 hours. Even if the creature can enter the temple, the magic there hinders it; whenever it makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw inside the temple, it must roll a **d4** and subtract the number rolled from the **d20** roll.\n\nIn addition, the sensors created by divination spells can't appear inside the temple, and creatures within can't be targeted by divination spells.\n\nFinally, whenever any creature in the temple regains hit points from a spell of 1st level or higher, the creature regains additional hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1 hit point).\n\nThe temple is made from opaque magical force that extends into the Ethereal Plane, thus blocking ethereal travel into the temple's interior. Nothing can physically pass through the temple's exterior. It can't be dispelled by dispel magic, and antimagic field has no effect on it. A disintegrate spell destroys the temple instantly.\n\nCasting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.",

Each target's body is left behind in a state of suspended animation; it has the **Unconscious** condition, doesn't need food or air, and doesn't age.\n\nA target's astral form resembles its body in almost every way, replicating its game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that trails from between the shoulder blades of the astral form. The cord fades from view after 1 foot. If the cord is cut—which happens only when an effect states that it does so—the target's body and astral form both die.\n\nA target's astral form can travel through the Astral Plane. The moment an astral form leaves that plane, the target's body and possessions travel along the silver cord, causing the target to re-enter its body on the new plane.\n\nAny damage or other effects that apply to an astral form have no effect on the target's body and vice versa. If a target's body or astral form drops to 0 Hit Points, the spell ends for that target. The spell ends for all the targets if you take a Magic `action` to dismiss it.\n\nWhen the spell ends for a target who isn't dead, the target reappears in its body and exits the state of suspended animation.",

If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a No effect chance of capsizing.\n\nThe water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.\n\n**Part Water**\nYou part water in the area and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.\n\n**Redirect Flow**\nYou cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.\n\n**Whirlpool**\nYou cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area, which must be at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. The whirlpool lasts until you choose a different effect or the spell ends. The whirlpool is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature in the water and within 25 feet of the whirlpool is pulled 10 feet toward it. When a creature enters the whirlpool for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, it makes a **Strength saving throw**. On a failed save, the creature takes **2d8** `Bludgeoning damage`. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.\n\nThe glyph is nearly imperceptible and requires a successful **Wisdom (Perception) check** against your spell save DC to notice.\n\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, you set its trigger and choose whether it's an explosive rune or a spell glyph, as explained below.\n\n**Set the Trigger**\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, common triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, or approaching within a certain distance of it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, common triggers include opening that object or seeing the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.\n\nYou can refine the trigger so that only creatures of certain types activate it (for example, the glyph could be set to affect Aberrations). You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\n\n**Explosive Rune**\nWhen triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius `Sphere` centered on the glyph. Each creature in the area makes a **Dexterity saving throw**. A creature takes **5d8** Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or `Thunder damage` (your choice when you create the glyph) on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\n**Spell Glyph**\nYou can store a prepared spell of level 3 or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way.\n\nWhen the glyph is triggered, the stored spell takes effect. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons Hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it.

A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren't changed.\n\nThe tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to notice the illusion.

The target makes a **Charisma saving throw**. On a failed save, your soul enters the target's body, and the target's soul becomes trapped in the container. On a successful save, the target resists your efforts to possess it, and you can't attempt to possess it again for 24 hours.\n\nOnce you possess a creature's body, you control it.

The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.\n\nPayment can take a variety of forms. A Celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a Fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.\n\nA task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth `100 GP` per minute. A task measured in hours requires `1,000 GP` per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires `10,000 GP` per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.\n\nAfter the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you if possible.

Each layer forces the creature to make a **Dexterity saving throw** or be affected by that layer's properties as described in the Prismatic Layers table.\n\nThe wall, which has AC 10, can be destroyed one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. If a layer is destroyed, it is gone for the duration. Antimagic Field has no effect on the wall, and Dispel Magic can affect only the violet layer.\n\n| Order | Effects |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1 | **Red.** *Failed Save:* **12d6** `Fire damage`. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. *Additional Effects*: Nonmagical ranged attacks can't pass through this layer, which is destroyed if it takes at least 25 `Cold damage`. |\n| 2 | **Orange.** *Failed Save:* **12d6** `Acid damage`. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. *Additional Effects:* Magical ranged attacks can't pass through this layer, which is destroyed by a strong wind (such as the one created by Gust of Wind). |\n| 3 | **Yellow.** *Failed Save:* **12d6** `Lightning damage`. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. *Additional Effects:* The layer is destroyed if it takes at least 60 `Force damage`. |\n| 4 | **Green.** *Failed Save:* **12d6** `Poison damage`. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. *Additional Effects:* A Passwall spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer. |\n| 5 | **Blue.** *Failed Save:* **12d6** `Cold damage`. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. *Additional Effects:* The layer is destroyed if it takes at least 25 `Fire damage`. |\n| 6 | **Indigo.** *Failed Save:* The target has the **Restrained** condition and makes a **Constitution saving throw** at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the condition ends. If it fails three times, it has the **Petrified** condition until it is freed by an effect like the Greater Restoration spell. The successes and failures needn't be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind. *Additional Effects:* Spells can't be cast through this layer, which is destroyed by **Bright Light** shed by the Daylight spell. |\n| 7 | **Violet.** *Failed Save:* The target has the **Blinded** condition and makes a **Wisdom saving throw** at the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the condition ends. On a failed save, the condition ends, and the creature teleports to another plane of existence (DM's choice). *Additional Effects:* This layer is destroyed by Dispel Magic. |",

The image is purely visual; it isn't accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.\n\nAs a Magic `action`, you can cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.\n\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, since things can pass through it. A creature that takes a Study `action` to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful **Intelligence (Investigation) check** against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.",

The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, it must remain in place; if it is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.\n\nThe glyph is nearly imperceptible and requires a successful **Wisdom (Perception) check** against your spell save DC to notice.\n\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, you set its trigger and choose which effect the symbol bears: Death, Discord, Fear, Pain, Sleep, or Stunning. Each one is explained below.\n\n**Set the Trigger**\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, common triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, or approaching within a certain distance of it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, common triggers include opening that object or seeing the glyph.\n\nYou can refine the trigger so that only creatures of certain types activate it (for example, the glyph could be set to affect Aberrations). You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\n\nOnce triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius `Sphere` with **Dim Light** for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the `Sphere` when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the `Sphere` for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. A creature is targeted only once per turn.\n\n**Death**\nEach target makes a **Constitution saving throw**, taking **10d10** `Necrotic damage` on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful save.\n\n**Discord**\nEach target makes a **Wisdom saving throw**. On a failed save, a target argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.\n\n**Fear**\nEach target must succeed on a **Wisdom saving throw** or have the **Frightened** condition for 1 minute. While **Frightened**, the target must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.\n\n**Pain**\nEach target must succeed on a **Constitution saving throw** or have the **Incapacitated** condition for 1 minute.\n\n**Sleep**\nEach target must succeed on a **Wisdom saving throw** or have the **Unconscious** condition for 10 minutes. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone takes an `action` to shake it awake.\n\n**Stunning**\nEach target must succeed on a **Wisdom saving throw** or have the **Stunned** condition for 1 minute.",

Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The DM rolls **1d100** and consults the Teleportation Outcome table and the explanations after it.\n\n| Familiarity | Mishap | Similar Area | Off Target | On Target |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Permanent circle | — | — | — | 01-00 |\n| Linked object | — | — | — | 01-00 |\n| Very familiar | 01-05 | 06-13 | 14-24 | 25-00 |\n| Seen casually | 01-33 | 34-43 | 44-53 | 54-00 |\n| Viewed once or described | 01-43 | 44-53 | 54-73 | 74-00 |\n| False destination | 01-50 | 51-00 | — | — |\n\n**Familiarity**\nHere are the meanings of the terms in the table's Familiarity column:\n\n- \"Permanent circle\" means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know.\n- \"Linked object\" means you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard's library.\n- \"Very familiar\" is a place you have visited often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell.\n- \"Seen casually\" is a place you have seen more than once but with which you aren't very familiar.\n- \"Viewed once or described\" is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic, or a place you know through someone else's description, perhaps from a map.\n- \"False destination\" is a place that doesn't exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a location that no longer exists.\n\n**Mishap**\nThe spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes **3d10** `Force damage`, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).\n\n**Similar Area**\nYou and your group (or the target object) appear in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. You appear in the closest similar place. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might appear in another person's laboratory in the same city.\n\n**Off Target**\nYou and your group (or the target object) appear **2d12** miles away from the destination in a random direction. Roll **1d8** for the direction: 1, east; 2, southeast; 3, south; 4, southwest; 5, west; 6, northwest; 7, north; or 8, northeast.\n\n**On Target**\nYou and your group (or the target object) appear where you intended.",
